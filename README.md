*Warning: This project is in development, do not use yet.*

```Earlgrey2d``` is a "homebrewed" Clojure game engine over LibGdx aimed primarily for the author's personal use, following no
particular philosophy other than perhaps "be comfortable".

With that said, I also believe that I should open source
this since someone else might find this useful.
I will also try to write "good" documentation and provide
easy interfaces for easy, common features, and leave complicated features
possible thanks to LibGdx and Clojure's Java interop.
